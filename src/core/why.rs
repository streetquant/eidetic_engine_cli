//! Memory selection explanation (EE-150).
//!
//! Provides the `ee why <memory-id>` command which explains:
//! - How a memory was stored (provenance, trust class)
//! - How it would be retrieved (scoring factors)
//! - How it would be selected for packs (relevance, utility, importance)
//! - Related memory links (supports, contradicts, derived_from, etc.)
//!
//! This makes the system explainable and auditable.
